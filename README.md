Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-backend.git
cd ecommerce-backend

Install dependencies:

bash

npm install

Set up your environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory:

bash

touch .env

Fill in the .env file with the following:

env

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name

Run the server:

bash

    npm run dev

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000.
Features
1. Authentication & Authorization
    Role-based Authorization: Routes protected based on user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular users).

2. Node Caching

    In-memory Caching: Common queries and data (e.g., product listings) are cached using Node.js to reduce database load and improve performance.

3. CRUD Operations

    Users: Create, read, update, and delete users. Admins can manage all users, while regular users can only manage their own accounts.
    Products: Full CRUD functionality for products, including file upload for product images using Multer and Cloudinary.
    Orders: Manage orders, track status, and associate orders with users.

4. Input Validation

    Request Validation: Data validation for incoming requests using middleware to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious inputs.

5. File Uploads

    Multer & Cloudinary Integration: Product images are uploaded and stored on Cloudinary.

6. Error Handling

    Global Error Handling: Centralized error handling middleware to capture and return meaningful error messages to the client.
